# Test scenarios

1. I just found this app and want to find out if a public place I was recently visiting has any infection markers.
2. I found out I was in contact with someone infected and want to add a marker to a place I recently visited.
3. I added one of the markers by accident, so I remove it.
3. Returning to the site, because:
	- I found out I have a confirmed infection and want to update my markers.
	- I found out I am not infected and want to hide my markers.
